                    Which Debts Are Worth The Bank's Effort</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-item-description">
                    The "Which Debts Are Worth The Bank's Effort" project is a data analysis project that involves analyzing a bank's recovery strategies for delinquent debts. The project aims to identify whether the extra effort and cost incurred by the bank at higher recovery strategy levels result in a significant increase in the amount of money recovered from customers. The analysis is based on a dataset of customer information, including demographic data and loan information, which is used to calculate the expected recovery amount for each customer. The project involves data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, and statistical analysis to determine whether there is a significant discontinuity in the amount recovered at higher recovery strategy levels. The project has practical implications for the bank's collection efforts and can help inform decisions about how to allocate resources for debt collection.

                <p class="portfolio-item-description">
                    The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?

                <p class="portfolio-item-description">
                    The "Streamlining Employee Data" project is a data analysis project that involves organizing and merging human resources data for a small business. The project aims to create a structured and unified view of employee data by gathering all available information about a specific employee into a single file. The analysis is based on scattered data from various sources, including Excel files, CSVs, JSON files, and SQL databases. The project involves data cleaning and preparation, merging data from different sources into a pandas DataFrame, and exporting the merged data to a CSV file. The project addresses the challenge of data management in a growing business and provides a foundation for future data-driven decision-making.

                    This portfolio focuses on COVID-19, the respiratory virus that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, after it had spread across the globe, causing major outbreaks in countries such as Iran, South Korea, and Italy. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets, and governments have implemented country-wide policies such as shutdowns and quarantines to slow the spread. To monitor and learn from the pandemic, organizations such as the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering have created publicly available data repositories to consolidate data from sources like the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Ministry of Health from multiple countries. This notebook visualizes COVID-19 data from the first few weeks of the outbreak to examine at what point the virus became a global pandemic. It's important to note that the data used in this project was pulled on March 17, 2020, and may not reflect the most up-to-date information available.

                    Life expectancy at birth is a measure of the average a living being is expected to live. It takes into account several demographic factors like gender, country, or year of birth. Life expectancy at birth can vary along time or between countries because of many causes: the evolution of medicine, the degree of development of countries, or the effect of armed conflicts. Life expectancy varies between gender, as well. The data shows that women live longer that men. Why? Several potential factors, including biological reasons and the theory that women tend to be more health conscious.

                    In this project, we will take a look at data on SATs across public schools in New York City. Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process. Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.
